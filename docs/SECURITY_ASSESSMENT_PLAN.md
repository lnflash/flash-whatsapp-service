# Flash Connect - Security Assessment Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive security assessment plan for the Flash Connect, focusing on identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in the application.

## Security Assessment Approach

### Security Assessment Layers

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
   - Code analysis for security vulnerabilities
   - Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
   - Secrets detection to prevent credential leakage

2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
   - Security testing against a running application
   - API security testing
   - Session management testing

3. **Penetration Testing**
   - Simulated attacks against the application
   - Exploitation of identified vulnerabilities
   - Post-exploitation analysis

### Security Coverage Goals

- **OWASP Top 10**: Full coverage of all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Secure Coding**: 100% compliance with secure coding standards
- **Third-party Dependencies**: All dependencies scanned and evaluated

## Vulnerability Assessment Areas

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Authentication Testing
- Test account linking flow for security vulnerabilities
- Test OTP implementation for brute force resilience
- Test session management for security weaknesses
- Test token generation and validation for cryptographic weaknesses

#### Authorization Testing
- Test access control for different user roles
- Test permission boundaries for sensitive operations
- Test MFA enforcement for critical operations
- Test privilege escalation scenarios

### Data Security

#### Data Encryption
- Test encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Test encryption in transit for all communications
- Test key management processes
- Test cryptographic implementation

#### Data Validation
- Test input validation across all entry points
- Test for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, GraphQL)
- Test file upload security (if applicable)
- Test output encoding and sanitization

### API Security

#### API Vulnerability Testing
- Test API authentication mechanisms
- Test API rate limiting implementation
- Test API for information disclosure
- Test webhook security implementation

#### Third-party API Integration
- Test Twilio integration security
- Test Flash API integration security
- Test Maple AI integration security
- Test other third-party service integrations

### Infrastructure Security

#### Configuration Security
- Test Docker container security
- Test Node.js security configuration
- Test Redis security configuration
- Test RabbitMQ security configuration

#### Network Security
- Test for exposed ports and services
- Test TLS implementation and configuration
- Test network segmentation
- Test firewall rules and network ACLs

## Penetration Testing Methodology

### Reconnaissance Phase
- Information gathering about the application architecture
- Identification of potential attack surfaces
- Enumeration of exposed assets and services

### Scanning Phase
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Manual vulnerability identification
- Service fingerprinting and version detection

### Exploitation Phase
- Exploit discovered vulnerabilities
- Chain vulnerabilities for privilege escalation
- Document successful exploit paths

### Post-Exploitation Phase
- Assess potential impact of vulnerabilities
- Determine data access capabilities
- Document findings and evidence

### Reporting Phase
- Document all identified vulnerabilities
- Provide severity ratings (CVSS scores)
- Recommend mitigation strategies

## Specific Attack Scenarios to Test

1. **Session Hijacking**
   - Attempt to steal or forge session tokens
   - Test session fixation vulnerabilities
   - Test session timeout enforcement

2. **Authentication Bypass**
   - Test for OTP bypass vulnerabilities
   - Test for authentication logic flaws
   - Test for weak password reset mechanisms

3. **Injection Attacks**
   - Test GraphQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Test NoSQL injection in Redis operations
   - Test command injection in system calls

4. **Business Logic Attacks**
   - Test for race conditions in financial operations
   - Test transaction manipulation vulnerabilities
   - Test notification manipulation

5. **Data Leakage**
   - Test for sensitive data exposure in responses
   - Test for excessive data in error messages
   - Test for information disclosure in logs

6. **Denial of Service**
   - Test API rate limiting effectiveness
   - Test resource exhaustion vulnerabilities
   - Test memory consumption vulnerabilities

## Tools and Infrastructure

### SAST Tools
- SonarQube for code quality and security analysis
- NPM Audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- ESLint with security plugins
- GitLeaks for secrets detection

### DAST Tools
- OWASP ZAP for dynamic scanning
- Burp Suite for API testing
- Custom scripts for specific attacks

### Penetration Testing Tools
- Metasploit Framework
- Kali Linux toolkit
- Custom exploitation scripts

## Security Assessment Schedule

- **Continuous Security Checks**: Run in CI/CD pipeline on every commit
- **Scheduled Scans**: Full vulnerability scan weekly
- **Penetration Testing**: Complete penetration test quarterly
- **Security Review**: Comprehensive security review before major releases

## Vulnerability Management Process

1. **Vulnerability Identification**
   - Document vulnerability details
   - Assign CVSS score
   - Determine potential impact

2. **Vulnerability Prioritization**
   - Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0): Immediate fix required
   - High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): Fix within 7 days
   - Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): Fix within 30 days
   - Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9): Fix during normal development cycle

3. **Vulnerability Remediation**
   - Develop and test fix
   - Deploy fix following change management process
   - Verify fix effectiveness

4. **Vulnerability Reporting**
   - Maintain vulnerability database
   - Generate security metrics
   - Report to stakeholders

## Security Incident Response

1. **Incident Detection**
   - Security monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Alert triggers

2. **Incident Analysis**
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Preserve evidence

3. **Containment Strategy**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Block attack vectors
   - Prevent further exploitation

4. **Recovery Process**
   - Remove malicious components
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Verify system integrity

5. **Post-Incident Activities**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Update security controls
   - Document lessons learned
