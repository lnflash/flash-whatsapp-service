# Pending Payment Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete pending payment system that allows Flash users to send money to non-Flash users, using the admin wallet as escrow.

## Key Components

### 1. PendingPaymentService
- Manages pending payment records in Redis
- Tracks payments by sender and recipient phone
- Generates secure claim codes
- Handles claim processing

### 2. Admin Wallet Escrow
- Uses `FLASH_AUTH_TOKEN` admin account as middleman
- Sender â†’ Admin wallet â†’ Recipient flow
- No new GraphQL endpoints required

### 3. Send Command Enhancement
When sending to contacts without Flash accounts:
```
send 10 to john
```
- Sends $10 to admin wallet as escrow
- Creates pending payment record
- Notifies recipient via WhatsApp (if possible)
- Shows claim code to sender

### 4. Pending Command
New command to manage pending payments:
- `pending` - Show received pending payments
- `pending sent` - Show sent pending payments
- `pending received` - Show payments waiting for you
- `pending claim ABC123` - Manual claim with code

### 5. Auto-Claim Feature
When recipient creates Flash account:
- Automatically checks for pending payments
- Claims all pending payments for their phone number
- Transfers from admin wallet to user
- Shows total claimed amount

## Usage Examples

### Sender Flow
```
User: send 10 to john
Bot: âœ… $10.00 sent to escrow for john!

They'll receive it when they create a Flash account.
Claim code: A1B2C3D4
```

### Recipient Flow
```
Recipient receives WhatsApp notification:
ðŸ’° Pending Payment

From: @sender
Amount: $10.00 USD
Claim Code: A1B2C3D4
Expires in: 30 days

ðŸ“± To claim this payment:
1. Download Flash app
2. Create account with this number
3. Payment will be auto-credited!
```

### Auto-Claim on Account Link
```
User: verify 123456
Bot: Your Flash account has been successfully linked!

ðŸ’° Great news! You had 2 pending payments totaling $25.00 that have been automatically credited to your account!

Type "balance" to see your updated balance.
```

## Benefits

2. **No Lost Funds** - Payments wait for recipients

- All transfers are logged and traceable

## Future Enhancements
