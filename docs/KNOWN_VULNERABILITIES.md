## Security Measures Implemented

### Package Override Strategy

The following overrides have been added to `package.json` to force secure versions:

```json
"overrides": {
  "tar-fs": "^3.0.0",
  "puppeteer-core": {
    "ws": "^8.18.0"
  }
}
```

### Additional Security Layers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Strict input validation on all endpoints
   - File uploads are not supported, eliminating tar-related risks
   - WebSocket connections are authenticated

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Enhanced rate limiting prevents DoS attacks
   - Per-endpoint and per-user limits are enforced
   - Suspicious activity triggers automatic blocking

3. **Network Security**
   - CORS properly configured
   - Request size limits implemented
   - Security headers via Helmet

4. **Monitoring**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated security scanning in CI/CD
   - Real-time security monitoring

## Ongoing Security Practices

### Regular Audits
- **Daily**: Automated npm audit in CI/CD pipeline
- **Weekly**: Manual review of new vulnerabilities
- **Monthly**: Full dependency update cycle
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security audit

### Dependency Management
1. Keep `package-lock.json` committed and up to date
2. Use `npm ci` for production installations
3. Regular updates of all dependencies
4. Monitor security advisories for whatsapp-web.js

## Production Recommendations

While the immediate vulnerabilities are resolved, for production deployment:

1. **Consider WhatsApp Business API**
   - More stable and officially supported
   - Better security guarantees
   - No puppeteer dependency chain

2. **Container Security**
   - Run in isolated Docker containers
   - Use read-only file systems where possible
   - Implement container scanning

3. **Network Isolation**
   - Deploy in private subnets
   - Use WAF for additional protection
   - Implement proper firewall rules
