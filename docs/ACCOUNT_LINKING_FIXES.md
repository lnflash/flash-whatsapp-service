# Account Linking Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Verification Code Prompt After Successful Linking

**Problem**: After successfully verifying with a 6-digit code and receiving the welcome message, the bot would still append "ðŸ’¡ Enter your 6-digit verification code" to the response.

**Root Cause**: The session object used for determining contextual hints was not updated after successful verification, so the bot still thought the user was unverified when adding hints.

**Fix**: 
- Added a check to skip hints for verification success responses
- Updated onboarding progress immediately after verification
- Changed the unverified hint message to be less confusing

### 2. Group Messages Not Recognizing Linked Status

**Problem**: Users who had successfully linked their accounts in DM were being asked to link again when messaging in groups.

**Root Cause**: The WhatsApp ID extraction and session lookup was working correctly - this was actually a side effect of issue #1. The bot was recognizing the user but showing the wrong hint.

## Changes Made

### 1. Skip Hints for Verification Success (`whatsapp.service.ts`)

```typescript
// For verification success responses, skip hints since the user just verified
const isVerificationSuccess = command.type === CommandType.VERIFY && 
  response.includes('Welcome') && response.includes('connected');

if (!isVerificationSuccess) {
  // Collect all potential hints
  const baseHint = this.getContextualHint(session, command);
  if (baseHint && !response.includes('ðŸ’¡')) {
    hints.push(`ðŸ’¡ ${baseHint}`);
  }
}
```

### 2. Update Onboarding Progress (`whatsapp.service.ts`)

Added onboarding progress updates in two places:
- After successful verification without pending payments
- After successful verification with pending payments

```typescript
// Mark onboarding step as complete BEFORE returning
// This ensures the next response won't show verification hints
await this.onboardingService.updateProgress(whatsappId, 'verify_account');
```

### 3. Improved Hint Message (`whatsapp.service.ts`)

Changed the unverified user hint from:
```typescript
return 'Enter your 6-digit verification code';
```

To:
```typescript
return 'Complete verification with your 6-digit code';
```

This is less confusing if shown accidentally and makes it clear verification isn't complete.

## Testing

1. Link account in DM
2. Enter verification code
3. Confirm no "Enter your 6-digit verification code" hint appears
4. Test commands in both DM and group
5. Confirm bot recognizes linked status in both contexts

## Future Improvements

1. Consider reloading the session after any state-changing operation (link, verify, unlink)
2. Add session caching with proper invalidation
3. Improve hint logic to be more context-aware
