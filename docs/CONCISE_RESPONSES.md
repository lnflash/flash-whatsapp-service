# Concise Response Implementation

## Overview
Updated the WhatsApp bot to provide ultra-concise responses limited to 140 characters maximum, making interactions faster and more mobile-friendly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Command Parser Enhancement
- Added "sent" as an alias for "send" command to handle common typos
- Pattern updated: `/^(?:send|sent)\s+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s+to\s+(?:@?(\w+)|(\+?\d{10,})|(\w+))(?:\s+(.*))?$/i`

### 2. AI Response Limits
Updated Gemini AI configuration:
- **Max output tokens**: Reduced from 1024 to 50
- **Prompt instructions**: Added explicit 140 character limit requirement
- **No truncation**: Relies on AI model to respect the character limit

### 3. Help Command Responses
Drastically shortened all help messages:

#### Before:
```
üåü *Welcome to Pulse!*

*Getting Started:*
‚Ä¢ `link` - Connect your Flash account
‚Ä¢ `price` - Check current Bitcoin price
‚Ä¢ `help` - Show this help message

üí° Type `link` to connect your Flash account and unlock all features!
```

#### After:
```
Welcome! Type 'link' to connect Flash account. 'price' for BTC price.
```

### 4. Unknown Command Messages
Simplified error messages:

#### Before:
```
‚ùì Keep your finger on it.

Type `help` to see available commands, or try:
‚Ä¢ `balance` - Check your balance
‚Ä¢ `send 10 to @username` - Send money
‚Ä¢ `receive 20` - Create invoice

üí¨ You can also ask questions in plain English!
```

#### After:
```
Keep your finger on it. Try 'help' or 'balance'.
```

### 5. Error Messages Enhanced
Added more informative but still concise error messages for common payment failures:
- Account inactive: Explains possible reasons and suggests contacting support
- Insufficient balance: Shows required amount
- Limit errors: Suggests checking account limits

## Results

### Message Length Comparison
| Message Type | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Welcome (not linked) | 165 chars | 70 chars |
| Verify prompt | 210 chars | 58 chars |
| Full help (linked) | 790 chars | 70 chars |
| Unknown command | 186 chars | 44 chars |

### Benefits
1. **Faster responses**: Less text to read and process
2. **Mobile-friendly**: Fits better on small screens
3. **Clear actions**: Direct instructions without fluff
4. **Consistent style**: All messages follow same concise pattern

## Examples

### User Input: "sent 0.5 to jabari"
**Before**: 600+ character explanation about Bitcoin, linking accounts, request command usage
**After**: "sent" is now recognized as "send" - processes payment directly

### User Input: "help"
**Before**: Multi-paragraph formatted list with emojis and categories
**After**: `Commands: balance, send 5 to @user, receive 10, history, price, help`

### User Input: Unknown command
**Before**: Multi-line suggestion with examples
**After**: `Keep your finger on it. Try 'help' or 'balance'.`

## Technical Implementation
- AI prompt explicitly requires <140 char responses
- Token limit enforces brevity at model level
- No post-processing truncation - trusts AI to follow instructions
- All hardcoded messages updated to be concise
- Tests updated to match new responses
