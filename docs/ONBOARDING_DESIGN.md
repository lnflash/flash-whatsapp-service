# Onboarding Design Philosophy

## Overview

The Pulse onboarding system is designed to be **intuitive, non-intrusive, and helpful** - guiding new users without blocking experienced ones.

## Key Principles

### 1. **First Impressions Matter**
When a new user sends any message, they receive a friendly welcome that:
- Clearly introduces Pulse
- Shows main capabilities
- Provides clear next steps
- Allows immediate access to all features

### 2. **Help Means Help**
When users type "help", they should **always** get help - never progress bars or onboarding content.

### 3. **Silent Progress Tracking**
Onboarding progress is tracked in the background without interrupting the user experience.

### 4. **Contextual, Not Intrusive**
Hints appear only when:
- Relevant to the user's current state
- At least 1 minute has passed since last activity
- The user hasn't dismissed onboarding

### 5. **Easy Escape**
Users can skip onboarding by simply typing "skip" - no complex commands needed.

## User Flow

### New User Experience

```
User: "hello"
Pulse: üëã *Welcome to Pulse!*
       
       I'm your personal Bitcoin wallet assistant. I can help you:
       
       üí∏ Send & receive money instantly
       üí∞ Check your balance
       üì± Manage contacts
       üé§ Use voice commands
       
       *Ready to start?*
       Type `link` to connect your Flash account
       Type `help` to see all commands
       
       _Already a pro? Just start using any command!_
```

### Returning User Help

```
User: "help"
Pulse: ‚ö° *Quick Commands*
       
       ‚Ä¢ `link` - Connect Flash account
       ‚Ä¢ `balance` - Check your money
       ‚Ä¢ `send 10 to @john` - Send payment
       ‚Ä¢ `receive 20` - Request money
       ‚Ä¢ `help more` - See all commands
       
       What would you like to do?
```

### Contextual Hints

Hints appear subtly after user actions:
```
User: "balance"
Pulse: [Balance information]
       
       üí° _Try `send 5 to demo` to make your first payment_
```

## Implementation Details

### State Management
- `hasSeenWelcome`: Tracks if user has seen initial welcome
- `dismissed`: User has opted out of onboarding
- `completedSteps`: Array of completed onboarding steps
- `lastActivity`: Timestamp for hint timing

### Progress Steps
1. **Welcome** - First interaction
2. **Link Account** - Connect Flash wallet
3. **Verify Phone** - Complete verification
4. **Check Balance** - View funds
5. **First Send** - Make a payment

### Hint Timing
- Hints only appear after 60 seconds of inactivity
- Prevents overwhelming users with too much information
- Respects user's pace

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Show welcome message on first interaction only
- ‚úÖ Let users use any command immediately
- ‚úÖ Track progress silently in background
- ‚úÖ Celebrate completion once
- ‚úÖ Make skip option obvious

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Block commands during onboarding
- ‚ùå Show progress bars on help command
- ‚ùå Force users through steps
- ‚ùå Show hints on every message
- ‚ùå Make skip command complex

## Future Improvements

1. **Personalized Onboarding**
   - Different flows for different user types
   - Skip steps based on user behavior

2. **Smart Hint Timing**
   - ML-based hint timing
   - Context-aware suggestions

3. **Gamification**
   - Optional achievements
   - Progress rewards

4. **A/B Testing**
   - Test different welcome messages
   - Optimize conversion rates

## Metrics to Track

- Welcome message engagement rate
- Skip rate
- Completion rate
- Time to first transaction
- User satisfaction scores

## Conclusion

Good onboarding is invisible - it guides without constraining, helps without annoying, and celebrates progress without being pushy. The goal is to make new users feel welcome and capable, not overwhelmed or restricted.
