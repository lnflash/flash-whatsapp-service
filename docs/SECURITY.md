# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Flash Connect and how to properly configure them.

## Overview

Flash Connect implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access:

1. **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data in Redis is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
2. **Secure Key Management**: Environment-based configuration with validation
3. **Session Security**: Encrypted sessions with rotation capabilities
4. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
5. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs
6. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging with privacy protection

## Encryption Implementation

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data stored in Redis is automatically encrypted:

```typescript
// Storing encrypted data
await redisService.setEncrypted('key', sensitiveData, ttl);

// Retrieving encrypted data
const data = await redisService.getEncrypted('key');
```

### What Gets Encrypted

- User sessions
- Authentication tokens
- Payment information
- Invoice data
- Pending payments
- User preferences

### Encryption Algorithm

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **IV**: Random 16-byte initialization vector per encryption
- **Auth Tag**: 16-byte authentication tag for integrity

## Environment Configuration

### Required Security Variables

```env
# Generate secure keys with: openssl rand -hex 32
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32+ character key>
ENCRYPTION_SALT=<16+ character salt>
HASH_SALT=<16+ character salt>
JWT_SECRET=<32+ character secret>
SESSION_SECRET=<32+ character secret>
WEBHOOK_SECRET=<32+ character secret>
```

### Key Generation

Generate secure keys for production:

```bash
# Generate encryption key
openssl rand -hex 32

# Generate salts
openssl rand -hex 16

# Generate secrets
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Development vs Production

In development, keys are auto-generated if not provided. In production, all security keys MUST be set or the application will fail to start.

## Session Management

### Session Security Features

1. **Encrypted Storage**: All session data is encrypted in Redis
2. **Session Rotation**: Configurable rotation intervals
3. **Secure Session IDs**: Cryptographically random 32-byte IDs
4. **TTL Management**: Automatic expiration of inactive sessions

### Session Configuration

```env
SESSION_EXPIRES_IN=86400         # 24 hours
SESSION_ROTATION_INTERVAL=3600   # 1 hour
```

## Privacy Protection

### Phone Number Hashing

Phone numbers used as keys are hashed for privacy:

```typescript
const hashedKey = redisService.hashKey('prefix', phoneNumber);
```

### Audit Logging

Sensitive data is never logged:
- Phone numbers are hashed in logs
- Auth tokens are never logged
- Payment details are redacted

## Rate Limiting

### Default Limits

```env
# General endpoints
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000    # 1 minute
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=20              # 20 requests per minute

# Authentication endpoints
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=300000   # 5 minutes
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=5              # 5 attempts per 5 minutes

# Payment endpoints
PAYMENT_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000  # 1 minute
PAYMENT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=5            # 5 payments per minute
```

## Admin Security

### Admin Authentication

Admin commands require:
1. Phone number in `ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBERS` list
2. Optional MFA for sensitive operations
3. Session timeout after inactivity

### Configuration

```env
ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBERS=+1234567890,+0987654321
ADMIN_REQUIRE_MFA=true
ADMIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Key Rotation

Rotate encryption keys periodically:
1. Generate new keys
2. Update environment variables
3. Implement key versioning for gradual migration

### 2. Monitoring

Monitor for security events:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Invalid input patterns
- Session anomalies

### 3. Updates

Keep dependencies updated:
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Update dependencies
npm update

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
```

### 4. Access Control

- Use principle of least privilege
- Implement role-based access control
- Audit admin actions
- Review access logs regularly

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All security environment variables are set
- [ ] Keys are generated using cryptographically secure methods
- [ ] Redis has authentication enabled
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS is configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is properly configured
- [ ] Input validation is enabled
- [ ] Audit logging is configured
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate all keys and secrets
   - Review audit logs
   - Identify affected users
   - Patch vulnerabilities

2. **Communication**:
   - Notify affected users
   - Document the incident
   - Report to relevant authorities if required

3. **Prevention**:
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Update security procedures
   - Conduct security training

## Compliance

This implementation helps meet requirements for:
- GDPR (encryption of personal data)
- PCI DSS (encryption of payment data)
- SOC 2 (security controls)
