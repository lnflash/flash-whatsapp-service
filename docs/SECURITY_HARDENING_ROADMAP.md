# Security Hardening Roadmap for User Knowledge Base Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures and hardening steps for the user knowledge base feature that allows users to teach Pulse through personalized Q&A sessions. The feature stores user-provided answers in Redis with encryption and implements various security controls.

## Current Security Implementation

### 1. Data Encryption
- ✅ All user knowledge entries are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage
- ✅ Encryption is handled by the existing `CryptoService` 
- ✅ Each knowledge entry has a unique ID to prevent enumeration attacks

### 2. Access Control
- ✅ Knowledge entries are isolated per user (whatsappId-based segregation)
- ✅ Users can only access their own knowledge base
- ✅ No cross-user data access is possible

### 3. Data Retention
- ✅ 30-day TTL on all knowledge entries
- ✅ Automatic expiration prevents indefinite data retention
- ✅ Users can manually delete entries at any time

### 4. Input Validation
- ✅ Question and answer text is sanitized before storage
- ✅ Category names are lowercase-normalized to prevent duplicates
- ✅ Search queries are escaped to prevent injection

## Phase 1: Immediate Hardening (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Content Filtering
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Implement profanity filter for questions and answers
- [ ] Add PII (Personally Identifiable Information) detection
- [ ] Block storage of sensitive data patterns (SSN, credit cards, passwords)
- [ ] Add configurable word blocklist

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ContentFilter {
  detectPII(text: string): boolean;
  detectProfanity(text: string): boolean;
  detectSensitivePatterns(text: string): string[];
  sanitizeContent(text: string): string;
}
```

### 1.2 Rate Limiting
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Limit knowledge entries per user (max 100 per 24 hours)
- [ ] Limit search queries (max 50 per hour)
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for rapid requests
- [ ] Add circuit breaker for abuse detection

### 1.3 Input Size Limits
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Max answer length: 500 characters
- [ ] Max question length: 200 characters
- [ ] Max search query length: 100 characters
- [ ] Reject binary data or non-text content

## Phase 2: Enhanced Security (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Audit Logging
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Log all knowledge base operations (create, read, delete)
- [ ] Include timestamp, user ID, operation type, and content hash
- [ ] Store logs separately from main data with longer retention
- [ ] Implement log analysis for anomaly detection

**Log Structure:**
```typescript
interface KnowledgeAuditLog {
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  operation: 'create' | 'read' | 'delete' | 'search';
  knowledgeId?: string;
  contentHash: string;
  ipAddress?: string;
  userAgent?: string;
}
```

### 2.2 Content Moderation
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Implement AI-based content moderation using Gemini
- [ ] Flag potentially harmful or inappropriate content
- [ ] Admin review queue for flagged content
- [ ] Automatic blocking of repeat offenders

### 2.3 Data Anonymization
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Strip metadata from stored answers
- [ ] Hash user identifiers in logs after 7 days
- [ ] Implement data minimization practices
- [ ] Remove timezone/location indicators

## Phase 3: Advanced Protection (Month 2)

### 3.1 Behavioral Analysis
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Detect unusual usage patterns
- [ ] Flag accounts with suspicious activity
- [ ] Implement ML-based anomaly detection
- [ ] Create risk scoring system

### 3.2 Encryption Key Management
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Implement key rotation (monthly)
- [ ] Use separate encryption keys per user
- [ ] Secure key storage with HSM/KMS integration
- [ ] Implement key escrow for compliance

### 3.3 Privacy Controls
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] User consent management for data storage
- [ ] Data export functionality (GDPR compliance)
- [ ] Right to erasure implementation
- [ ] Privacy policy integration

## Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Month 3)

### 4.1 Compliance
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] GDPR compliance certification
- [ ] SOC 2 Type II preparation
- [ ] Data residency controls
- [ ] Compliance reporting dashboard

### 4.2 Advanced Threat Protection
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- [ ] Real-time malware scanning of content
- [ ] DDoS protection for knowledge base endpoints
- [ ] Zero-trust architecture implementation

### 4.3 Disaster Recovery
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Encrypted backups of knowledge base
- [ ] Cross-region replication
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery capability
- [ ] Regular disaster recovery drills

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Never log sensitive user answers in plaintext
2. Always use parameterized queries for Redis operations
3. Validate all input on both client and server side
4. Use constant-time comparison for security checks
5. Keep dependencies updated (monthly security patches)

### For Operations
1. Monitor Redis memory usage and set limits
2. Regular security audits (quarterly)
3. Penetration testing (bi-annually)
4. Security training for all team members
5. Incident response plan maintenance

### For Users
1. Clear communication about data usage
2. Regular reminders about not sharing sensitive info
3. Easy-to-use privacy controls
4. Transparent data retention policies
5. Regular security tips in app

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| Data breach | Low | High | Encryption, access controls, monitoring |
| PII exposure | Medium | High | Content filtering, data minimization |
| Abuse/Spam | High | Medium | Rate limiting, content moderation |
| Data loss | Low | Medium | Backups, replication |
| Compliance violation | Low | High | Audit logs, privacy controls |

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Knowledge entries created per hour
- Failed authentication attempts
- Encryption/decryption errors
- Storage capacity usage
- API response times

### Alert Thresholds
- > 1000 entries/hour from single user
- > 100 failed auth attempts/hour
- > 5% encryption errors
- > 80% storage capacity
- > 500ms p95 response time

## Implementation Timeline

```
Week 1-2:  Content filtering, rate limiting
Week 3-4:  Audit logging, content moderation
Month 2:   Behavioral analysis, key management
Month 3:   Compliance, advanced protection
Ongoing:   Monitoring, updates, training
```

## Success Criteria

1. Zero security incidents in production
2. 99.9% uptime for knowledge base feature
3. < 100ms average encryption overhead
4. 100% compliance with data regulations
5. User trust score > 4.5/5.0

## Conclusion
