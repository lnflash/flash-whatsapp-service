# Session Decryption and Flash API Price Error Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented for two non-critical issues in the Pulse application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Session Decryption Error
**Problem**: A corrupted session (`session:f950b1fa027a824a3e058eebbf8e90cd`) was causing repeated decryption errors whenever accessed. This was likely due to the session being created before encryption was implemented or with different encryption keys.

### 2. Flash API Price Errors
**Problem**: The Flash API was returning "PriceNotAvailableError" when trying to fetch Bitcoin prices during cache warming.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Session Cleanup Script

Created a Redis cleanup script at `/scripts/cleanup-corrupted-session.ts` that provides:

- **Single session cleanup**: Remove a specific corrupted session
- **Bulk cleanup**: Scan and remove all corrupted sessions
- **Safety features**: 
  - Confirmation prompts before deletion
  - Related WhatsApp mapping cleanup
  - Detailed logging

**Usage**:
```bash
# Clean up a specific session
npm run cleanup:session session:f950b1fa027a824a3e058eebbf8e90cd

# Clean up all corrupted sessions
npm run cleanup:all-corrupted
```

### 2. Enhanced Session Service Error Handling

Modified `SessionService.getSession()` to handle decryption errors gracefully:

- Detects decryption errors specifically
- Logs a warning instead of throwing an error
- Returns `null` to prevent cascading failures
- Suggests running the cleanup script in the log message

### 3. Improved Cache Warmer Error Handling

Enhanced the `CacheWarmerService.warmPriceCache()` method to:

- Track success/failure counts for price fetching
- Provide specific error messages for different failure types:
  - `PriceNotAvailableError`: Indicates unsupported currency or API configuration issue
  - Network errors: Indicates connectivity issues
  - General failures: Other API errors
- Continue warming cache for other currencies even if one fails
- Log summary of successes and failures

### 4. Enhanced Price Service Error Messages

Updated `PriceService.getBitcoinPrice()` to provide more specific error messages:

- Distinguishes between "no price data" and network errors
- Provides clearer error messages to help diagnose issues
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing error handling

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Log Noise**: Corrupted sessions no longer generate repeated error logs
2. **Better Diagnostics**: More specific error messages help identify the root cause of price fetching failures
3. **Improved Resilience**: Cache warming continues even if some currencies fail
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Simple commands to clean up corrupted sessions

## Future Considerations

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: Consider implementing automatic cleanup of sessions that fail decryption after N attempts
2. **Currency Validation**: Add a configuration for supported currencies to avoid attempting to fetch prices for unsupported ones
3. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for session corruption rate and price API success rate
4. **Migration Tool**: Create a tool to migrate sessions between different encryption keys if needed

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. **Session Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   # Try to clean up the problematic session
   npm run cleanup:session session:f950b1fa027a824a3e058eebbf8e90cd
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs**: Check that:
   - Session decryption errors show warnings instead of errors
   - Price fetching errors show specific failure reasons
   - Cache warming completes with a summary of results

3. **Cache Warming**: The cache warmer should now complete successfully even if some currencies fail, with clear reporting of which currencies succeeded or failed.
