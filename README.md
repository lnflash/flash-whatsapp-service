# Run tests
yarn test

# Lint code
yarn lint

# Format code
yarn format

# Build for production
yarn build
```

## Docker Support

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Docker deployment is NOT supported for Pulse. WhatsApp Web.js requires native Chrome/Chromium installation and does not work reliably in Docker containers. Please use the native PM2 deployment method described above.

## Currency Conversion

The service automatically converts USD wallet balances to the user's display currency using real-time exchange rates from the Flash API. Supported currencies include:
- JMD (Jamaican Dollar)
- EUR (Euro)
- USD (US Dollar)
- And more...

## Security

- Phone number verification required for account linking
- Auth tokens stored securely in Redis
- No MFA required for balance checks (user already authenticated via WhatsApp)
- All sensitive data excluded from logs

## Pending Payments Feature

The pending payments feature allows Flash users to send money to anyone via WhatsApp, even if the recipient doesn't have a Flash account yet:

### How it works:
1. **Send to any phone number**: Use `send [amount] to [phone]` to send money to any WhatsApp number
2. **Recipient gets notified**: The recipient receives a WhatsApp message with a claim code
3. **Easy claiming**: Recipients can claim by replying "link" to create an account
4. **Automatic credit**: Once linked, the pending payment is automatically credited
5. **30-day expiry**: Unclaimed payments are returned to sender after 30 days

### Pending payment commands:
- `pending` - View all your pending payments
- `pending sent` - View payments you've sent that are awaiting claim
- `pending received` - Check if you have money waiting to be claimed
- `pending claim [code]` - Claim a payment using the provided code

### Example flow:
```
Sender: send 10 to +18765551234
Bot: ‚úÖ $10.00 sent to +18765551234. They'll receive instructions to claim it.

[Recipient receives message]
Bot: üí∞ You have money waiting! @alice sent you $10.00
     Reply "link" to claim your payment.
     Claim code: ABC123

Recipient: link
[... account creation flow ...]
Bot: ‚úÖ Your $10.00 from @alice has been credited to your account!
```

## Admin Reconnection Feature

The admin reconnection feature allows authorized administrators to change the WhatsApp number connected to the bot without SSH access:

1. **Check Status**: `admin status` - Shows current connection info
2. **Reconnect**: `admin reconnect` - Generates and sends QR code via WhatsApp
3. **Scan QR**: Open WhatsApp on new device and scan the QR code
4. **Confirmation**: Bot sends welcome message from new number

This seamless process ensures zero downtime during number changes.

## Support Mode

The AI-powered support mode provides seamless handoff to human agents when users need assistance:

### How it works:
1. **Automatic Detection**: The AI detects when users request human support (e.g., "speak to an agent", "human help")
2. **Context Gathering**: Collects user info (username, balance, npub, recent conversation)
3. **Smart Routing**: Routes messages between multiple users and support simultaneously
4. **Easy Management**: Support agents reply with `@phone: message` to specific users
5. **Session Control**: Users type "exit support" to return to normal bot functions

### Support Agent Features:
- View all active sessions: Type `list` or `sessions`
- Reply to specific user: `@13059244435: Hello, how can I help?`
- End support session: `@13059244435: exit support`
- Automatic session info with each new connection

## Anonymous Tips

Send tips anonymously through direct messages:

### Features:
- **True Anonymity**: Tips sent via DM ensure sender identity is hidden
- **Group Tip Splitting**: Distribute tips evenly among Flash users in a group
- **Flexible Amounts**: Send any amount with optional messages
- **Privacy First**: Recipients only see "Someone sent you a tip"

### Tip Commands:
- `tip @username 5` - Send anonymous 5 USD tip
- `tip @alice 10 great job!` - Include a message with tip
- `tip group "Flash Users" 20` - Split $20 among all Flash users in the group
- `tip group "Dev Team" 50 thanks everyone` - Group tip with message

## Push Notifications

The service implements real-time payment notifications with a hybrid approach:

### How it works:
1. **WebSocket Subscriptions**: Primary real-time connection to Flash API for instant updates
2. **RabbitMQ Fallback**: Reliable message queue ensures notifications are never missed
3. **Automatic Setup**: Users are subscribed when they link their account
4. **Smart Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate notifications across both channels
5. **Rich Notifications**: Shows amount in BTC and fiat, sender info, and updated balance

### Notification Features:
- Instant WhatsApp message when payment is received
- Shows payment amount in both BTC and user's preferred currency
- Displays sender's username and memo if provided
- Includes updated wallet balance
- Works whether app is active or not

### Technical Architecture:
```
Flash API ‚Üí WebSocket/RabbitMQ ‚Üí PaymentNotificationService ‚Üí WhatsApp Message
```
