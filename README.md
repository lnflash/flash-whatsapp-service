- JMD (Jamaican Dollar)
- EUR (Euro)
- USD (US Dollar)
- And more...

## Security

- Phone number verification required for account linking
- Auth tokens stored securely in Redis
- No MFA required for balance checks (user already authenticated via WhatsApp)
- All sensitive data excluded from logs

## Pending Payments Feature

The pending payments feature allows Flash users to send money to anyone via WhatsApp, even if the recipient doesn't have a Flash account yet:

### How it works:
1. **Send to any phone number**: Use `send [amount] to [phone]` to send money to any WhatsApp number
2. **Recipient gets notified**: The recipient receives a WhatsApp message with a claim code
3. **Easy claiming**: Recipients can claim by replying "link" to create an account
4. **Automatic credit**: Once linked, the pending payment is automatically credited
5. **30-day expiry**: Unclaimed payments are returned to sender after 30 days

### Pending payment commands:
- `pending` - View all your pending payments
- `pending sent` - View payments you've sent that are awaiting claim
- `pending received` - Check if you have money waiting to be claimed
- `pending claim [code]` - Claim a payment using the provided code

### Example flow:
```
Sender: send 10 to +18765551234
Bot: ‚úÖ $10.00 sent to +18765551234. They'll receive instructions to claim it.

[Recipient receives message]
Bot: üí∞ You have money waiting! @alice sent you $10.00
     Reply "link" to claim your payment.
     Claim code: ABC123

Recipient: link
[... account creation flow ...]
Bot: ‚úÖ Your $10.00 from @alice has been credited to your account!
```

## Admin Reconnection Feature

The admin reconnection feature allows authorized administrators to change the WhatsApp number connected to the bot without SSH access:

1. **Check Status**: `admin status` - Shows current connection info
2. **Reconnect**: `admin reconnect` - Generates and sends QR code via WhatsApp
3. **Scan QR**: Open WhatsApp on new device and scan the QR code
4. **Confirmation**: Bot sends welcome message from new number

This seamless process ensures zero downtime during number changes.
