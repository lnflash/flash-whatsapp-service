# GitHub Push Instructions

To push this repository to GitHub and include the v0.0.1 tag, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (if not already created)

   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "flash-connect"
   - Choose the appropriate visibility (private is recommended for this type of project)
   - Do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license as we already have those

2. Add the GitHub repository as a remote

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/lnflash/flash-connect.git
   # OR if using SSH
   git remote add origin git@github.com:lnflash/flash-connect.git
   ```

3. Push the main branch

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. Push the tag

   ```bash
   git push origin v0.0.1
   ```

5. Verify on GitHub
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "tags" to see the v0.0.1 tag
   - Click on "Actions" to see if the workflows are running (you may need to set up the required secrets)

## Required GitHub Secrets

To use the GitHub Actions workflows, you'll need to set up the following secrets in your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Add the following secrets:

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or token
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_TEST`: SSH private key for test server deployment
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION`: SSH private key for production server deployment

- `SONAR_TOKEN`: SonarCloud token for code quality analysis
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: Snyk token for security scanning

## Next Steps After Push

1. Set up branch protection rules

   - Go to "Settings" > "Branches" > "Add rule"
   - Protect the main branch
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging

2. Set up Docker Hub repository

   - Create a repository named "flashapp/flash-connect" on Docker Hub

3. Continue implementation of Phase 5
   - Follow the tasks in docs/PHASE_5_CHECKLIST.md
