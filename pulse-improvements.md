📋 Medium Impact Improvements

1. Progressive Help Menu - Instead of wall of text, show interactive numbered menu
2. Contact Import Flow - Auto-detect and parse vCard shares
3. Transaction Tracking - "track ABC123" to check payment status
4. Multi-Step Progress Indicators - Show steps like "Step 1/3 ✓"
5. Contextual Hints - Smart tips based on user actions
6. Natural Language Support - "pay john 50 dollars" → send command
7. Quick Actions - "send 20 to last", "again" commands
8. Voice Mode Enhancement - Better voice indicators and confirmations

Which would you like to tackle next? I recommend starting with:

🎯 Progressive Help Menu

This would make the biggest immediate impact on new user experience. Instead of overwhelming users with all commands, we'd show:
Essential Commands:
1️⃣ balance - Check your wallet
2️⃣ send - Send money
3️⃣ receive - Get paid

Type number for details or 'more' for all commands

🚀 Natural Language Support

This would make the bot feel much more conversational:

- "what's my balance" → balance
- "send john 50 bucks" → send 50 to john
- "how much is bitcoin" → price

📱 Contact Import Flow

Since WhatsApp users frequently share contacts via vCards, we could auto-detect and parse them.

## **MKStack One-Shot Prompt: Nostr Influencer Micropayment Platform** Design and implement a **production-grade, full-stack platform** that connects businesses with social media creators. The platform should automatically track post performance across platforms like **Nostr, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook**, and **distribute micropayments** based on metrics such as likes, reposts, and zaps. ### ✅ Core Goals _ Match businesses with creators for paid campaigns _ Monitor content performance across platforms _ Automate Bitcoin and fiat micropayments _ Offer real-time insights and dashboards for both parties ### 💻 Tech Requirements _ **Framework**: Next.js (App Router preferred) _ **DB**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM) _ **Auth**: NextAuth.js with JWT _ **Payments**: Stripe (fiat) + Flash API (Bitcoin) _ **API**: GraphQL (Apollo Server) _ **Queue**: BullMQ or equivalent _ **UI**: React + Tailwind (with shadcn/ui) _ **State**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit _ **Realtime**: WebSocket support for live campaign + payment updates ### 📊 Key Features _ Business dashboard for campaign creation, performance, and payout history _ Creator dashboard for earnings, campaign invites, and post linking _ Social platform integration via polling or APIs (modular design) _ Role-based access control, email verification, and secure NWC connections _ Payments triggered via event-based jobs (BullMQ or equivalent) _ Charts for ROI, platform performance, and creator rankings ### 🔐 Non-Functional Requirements _ Rate limiting, validation (Zod or similar), XSS/SQLi protection _ Logging and monitoring (e.g. Sentry, Prometheus/Grafana) _ Modular, scalable, and testable codebase _ Comprehensive documentation and tests (unit + integration) _ Deployment-ready (Docker + Nginx + Redis + PostgreSQL) ### 📈 Revenue Model _ 2.5% fee on business wallet top-ups _ Premium analytics tools _ Optional creator discovery subscriptions --- You have freedom to: _ Refactor schemas or component boundaries as needed _ Choose libraries (e.g., for charts, state, job queues) where sensible _ Organize code for long-term scalability and maintainability Focus on **modular design**, **security**, and **scalable micropayments** logic. The output should be a clean, extensible base for a VC-ready social performance-to-payment engine.
