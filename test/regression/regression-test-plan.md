# Flash Connect - Regression Test Plan

This document outlines the regression testing strategy for the Flash Connect to ensure that existing functionality remains intact as new features are added.

## Regression Testing Approach

### Automated Testing Layers

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock all external dependencies
   - Focus on input validation, error handling, and business logic

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Test interactions with external services (using real services in test environment)
   - Focus on API contracts and error handling

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Simulate real user interactions
   - Focus on happy paths and critical error paths

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% of critical user flows
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% line coverage
- **Edge Case Coverage**: At least 90% of documented edge cases

## Automated Regression Test Suite

### Account Linking Flow

- Test account linking flow with valid phone number
- Test account linking flow with invalid phone number
- Test OTP verification with valid OTP
- Test OTP verification with invalid OTP
- Test OTP verification with expired OTP
- Test account linking with already linked account
- Test account unlinking

### Balance Check Flow

- Test balance check with linked account
- Test balance check with unlinked account
- Test balance check with expired session
- Test balance check with API error
- Test balance check with zero balance
- Test balance check with rate limiting

### Notification Flow

- Test payment received notification
- Test payment sent notification
- Test notification with user opted out
- Test notification with Twilio error
- Test notification outside 24-hour window
- Test duplicate notification suppression

### AI Support Flow

- Test help command with simple question
- Test help command with complex question
- Test help command with sensitive information
- Test help command with Maple AI error
- Test help command with unsupported feature
- Test help command with escalation to human support

## Manual Regression Test Cases

Some scenarios are difficult to automate and should be tested manually:

1. **Visual Verification**
   - Verify message formatting in WhatsApp
   - Verify rich message templates rendering

2. **Timing-Related Tests**
   - Verify session timeout behavior
   - Verify rate limiting behavior

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Verify system recovery after service outage
   - Verify message queue processing after restart

## Regression Testing Schedule

- **Pre-release Testing**: Complete regression test suite run before each release
- **Nightly Testing**: Automated regression tests run nightly
- **Post-deployment Testing**: Critical path tests run after each deployment

## Reporting and Metrics

- Test results stored in CI/CD pipeline
- Test coverage reports generated with each build
- Regression test metrics tracked over time:
  - Pass/fail rates
  - Test execution time
  - Code coverage trends

## Tools and Infrastructure

- **Test Framework**: Jest for unit and integration tests
- **E2E Testing**: Supertest for API testing, custom framework for WhatsApp flow testing
- **Mocking**: Jest mocks for external dependencies
- **CI/CD Integration**: Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions

## Handling Test Failures

1. **Critical Path Failures**
   - Block release if any critical path test fails
   - Immediate developer notification

2. **Non-Critical Failures**
   - Flag for review
   - Release can proceed with documented known issues

## Maintenance and Updates

- Regression test suite updated with each new feature
- Regular review of test coverage and effectiveness
- Periodic cleanup of obsolete tests
