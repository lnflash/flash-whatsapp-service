## Penetration Testing Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance

#### Information Gathering Techniques
- Review documentation to understand service architecture
- Identify all exposed endpoints and services
- Map dependencies and integration points
- Identify authentication and authorization mechanisms

#### Passive Reconnaissance
- Analyze public information about the service
- Review public code repositories (if available)
- Examine public API documentation

#### Active Reconnaissance
- Perform port scanning to identify open ports
- Perform service enumeration to identify running services
- Conduct API endpoint discovery
- Map application paths and functionality

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning

#### Automated Scanning
- Run OWASP ZAP against all identified endpoints
- Use Burp Suite for API endpoint scanning
- Perform dependency scanning with OWASP Dependency Check
- Use specialized tools for JWT analysis

#### Manual Inspection
- Review input validation mechanisms
- Inspect authentication flows
- Analyze session management implementation
- Evaluate access control mechanisms

### 3. Vulnerability Exploitation

### Attack Scenario 4: Data Exfiltration

**Objective:** Extract sensitive user data from the service

**Method:**
1. Test API endpoints for excessive data exposure
2. Look for sensitive data in error messages
3. Examine caching mechanisms for data leakage
4. Test logging systems for sensitive data capture
5. Analyze response headers for information disclosure

**Expected Security Controls:**
- Data minimization
- PII/financial data masking
- Secure error handling

### Attack Scenario 5: Denial of Service

**Objective:** Disrupt service availability

**Method:**
1. Test rate limiting effectiveness with automated requests
