# Voice Management Updates Test Plan

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Display Flash Username Instead of Phone Number
- Updated `VoiceManagementService.formatVoiceList()` to show Flash username
- Falls back to "unknown" if no username is available
- Fetches username through SessionService and UsernameService

### 2. Optional Name Parameter in 'voice add' Command
- Made the name parameter optional in `addVoice()` method
- Generates random names from a curated list (aurora, blaze, cascade, etc.)
- Falls back to numbered names (voice1, voice2) if all fun names are taken
- Updated command parser to support both formats:
  - `voice add [id]` - auto-generates name
  - `voice add [name] [id]` - uses custom name

### 3. Natural Language Voice Selection
- Added natural language patterns to CommandParserService
- Supports various phrases:
  - "switch voices to mary"
  - "change voice to beth"
  - "let me speak to john"
  - "change your voice to kim"
  - "use sarah's voice"
  - "speak as alex"
  - And many more variations

### 4. Updated Help Messages
- Updated voice help to show new command formats
- Added natural language examples
- Kept 'voice add' as explicit command only (no NLP variations)

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Voice List Display
1. Add a voice with a user who has a username
2. Add a voice with a user who doesn't have a username
3. Run `voice list` command
4. Verify usernames are displayed correctly

### Test 2: Auto-Generated Voice Names
1. Run `voice add EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`
2. Verify a random name is assigned (e.g., "aurora", "blaze", etc.)
3. Run multiple times to test name uniqueness

### Test 3: Custom Voice Names
1. Run `voice add sarah EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`
2. Verify "sarah" is used as the name

### Test 4: Natural Language Voice Selection
1. Add multiple voices
2. Test commands:
   - "switch voice to sarah"
   - "change your voice to john"
   - "let me speak to mary"
   - "use alex's voice"
3. Verify voice changes correctly

### Test 5: Edge Cases
1. Try to add a voice with a reserved name
2. Try to add a duplicate voice ID
3. Test voice selection with non-existent voice
4. Test empty voice list behavior
